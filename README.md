## Image Registration Experiments
First simple experiments for non-parametric image registration, written in **MATLAB**. Inspired by [**FAIR.m**](https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m), but not using it. Provides:

+ ### Distance Measures
  + SSD

+ ### Regularizers
  + Diffusive Energy
  + Curvature Energy

+ ### Optimization schemes
  + Gradient descent
  + Gau√ü-Newton optimization
  + Armijo line search
  + Support for Multi-Level startegy

+ ### Miscellaneous
  + Derivative test (1st + 2nd order) for multivariate functions
